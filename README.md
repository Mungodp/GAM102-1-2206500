# GAM102-MungoDakin-Poole
The long overdue repository for GAM102

For my Diorama I have decided to create a short and simple arcade game where you are a simple Honey Bee looking for pollen on different flowers.
It will include a dedicated player point of view and a functional character controller, for a simple navigation system. It has a clear enviroment 
of a woodland within a mountainous region/arena. It will also include a menu and in-game UI

License: The license I have chosen will be using will be the MIT license as I am happy for anyone to utilize or improve my project in any way they would like.
The main benefits of this particular license are that anyone can edit and adapt the material in private free of charge. However the license doesn't include 
any warranty, and has limited liability for the creator. 

All foliage enviromental assets are from:
