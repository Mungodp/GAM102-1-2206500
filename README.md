# GAM102-MungoDakin-Poole
The long overdue repository for GAM102

For my Diorama I have decided to create a short and simple arcade game where you are a simple Honey Bee looking for pollen on different flowers.
It will include a dedicated player point of view and a functional character controller, for a simple navigation system. It has a clear enviroment 
of a woodland within a mountainous region/arena. It will also include a menu and in-game UI

License: The license I have chosen will be using will be the MIT license as I am happy for anyone to utilize or improve my project in any way they would like.

All foliage enviromental assets are from:

LowPoly Enviroment Pack. 2017. Unity Asset Store, k0rveen
